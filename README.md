# DNASequencing
Algorithms applied in DNA Sequencing

## Introduction
This is a repository containing the Python implementations of some algorithms for DNA sequencing. I worked on this repository during my time in 12th grade.
Right now this repository is only for storage purpose, since I do not have sufficient time (and knowledge) to polish it into a complete project. Hope to be able do that in the near future.
